Our team approach in Amazon ML Challenge 2024
## Problem Statement: 
### Feature Extraction from Images

In this hackathon, the goal is to create a machine learning model that extracts entity values from images. This capability is crucial in fields like healthcare, e-commerce, and content moderation, where precise product information is vital. As digital marketplaces expand, many products lack detailed textual descriptions, making it essential to obtain key details directly from images. These images provide important information such as weight, volume, voltage, wattage, dimensions, and many more, which are critical for digital stores.

### Dataset: 
The dataset is divided into two main files:

- **train.csv**: Contains over 310,000 image links along with metadata.
- **test.csv**: Contains over 132,000 image links along with metadata.
  
Each dataset has the following columns:

1. **index:** An unique identifier (ID) for the data sample
2. **image_link**: Public URL where the product image is available for download. Example link - https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XfHPR36-L.jpg
3. **group_id**: Category code of the product
4. **entity_name:** Product entity name. For eg: ‚Äúitem_weight‚Äù 
5. **entity_value:** Product entity value. For eg: ‚Äú34 gram‚Äù
    Note: For test.csv, you will not see the column `entity_value` as it is the target variable.

### File Descriptions:

*source files*

1. **src/sanity.py**: Sanity checker to ensure that the final output file passes all formatting checks. Note: the script will not check if less/more number of predictions are present compared to the test file. See sample code in `src/test.ipynb` 
2. **src/utils.py**: Contains helper functions for downloading images from the image_link.
3. **src/constants.py:** Contains the allowed units for each entity type.
4. **sample_code.py:** We also provided a sample dummy code that can generate an output file in the given format. Usage of this file is optional. 

*Dataset files*

1. **dataset/train.csv**: Training file with labels (`entity_value`).
2. **dataset/test.csv**: Test file without output labels (`entity_value`). Generate predictions using your model/solution on this file's data and format the output file to match sample_test_out.csv (Refer the above section "Output Format")
3. **dataset/sample_test.csv**: Sample test input file.
4. **dataset/sample_test_out.csv**: Sample outputs for sample_test.csv. The output for test.csv must be formatted in the exact same way. Note: The predictions in the file might not be correct

## Model Pipeline

### ‚öôÔ∏è <span style="color:#2E8B57;">Approach Overview</span>

---

1. **üîç Text Extraction using PaddleOCR**:

   - We use **PaddleOCR** to extract text from the images.
   - This tool helps retrieve essential textual information from images accurately.

2. **üßπ Text Preprocessing**:

   - After extraction, the text is cleaned and preprocessed.
   - We remove any irrelevant characters and inconsistencies to make it easier to recognize entities.

3. **üìë Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:

   - A custom-trained **NER model** is used to identify key entity values such as weight, voltage, and dimensions.
   - The model predicts both the `entity_value` and the corresponding `entity_name` by locating their start and end indices.

4. **üßÆ Rule-based Recognition**:

   - If the NER model fails, we fall back to **Rule-based Recognition**.
   - This uses **regular expressions (regex)** to detect entities based on patterns (e.g., numerical values followed by units like "5.0 kg" or "220 volts").

5. **‚úÖ Final Entity Extraction**:
   - The extracted entities are finalized

## Results

Our model achieved the following results:

- **F1 Score**: 0.4 (highest)
- **Rank**: 290 out of 2500+ teams (74,824 Registrations)

## Conclusion 
This hackathon, spanning four days, was the longest we‚Äôve participated in so far. We faced challenges, particularly with the computational resources needed to process such a large volume of data. Processing the test.csv file, which involved downloading over **52 GB** of images and running them through an OCR model, took us collectively more than **20 hours**. Despite these obstacles, it was an invaluable experience to work on a real-world problem faced by Amazon. 

We are extremely grateful to Amazon for hosting such an engaging hackathon and look forward to competing again next year!
